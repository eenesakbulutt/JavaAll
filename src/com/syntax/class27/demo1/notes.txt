Recap;
Abstraction is a process of hiding implementation details and showing functionality only .
Abstraction classes:
are that are declared with abstract keyword they help us achieve abstraction.
abstraction helps us divide the workload in multiple child classes and it helps us reduce the complexity of code.
Rules;
1)use abstract class keyword to define abstract class.
2)we can have an abstract class with or without abstract methods.
3)we must declare a class as an abstract class even if we have a single abstract method inside it.
4)we can not create the object of an abstract class directly  but extend this class and
can create the object of child classes that way we will be able to use fields and methods
from abstract class.
5)We can not declare a class as final and abstract because final means no extension
and abstract means incomplete and some classes should extend it and complete it.
6)we can have public private protected members in abstract class.
But in interface always all the field are PUBLIC STATIC FINAL.
7)we can not have a method as static and abstract at the same time
8)we can not have a method as private and abstract because private members
do not participate in inheritance and we will never be able to provide body of that method.
9)we can not have a method of final and abstract.

Interface in Java

Interfaces in Java are also used to achieve abstraction .
Rules :
All the fields in an interface are by default public static and final
